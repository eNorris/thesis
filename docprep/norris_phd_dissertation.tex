\begin{Vita}
Edward Norris graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology in 2013 with a B.S. in both nuclear engineering and computer science, he went on to pursue a M.S. in computer science and a PhD in nuclear engineering.

His PhD work was funded by a fellowship through the NRC.

Previously he has participated in four summer internships with Sandia National Laboratories. While there, he served in various capacities ranging from cyber defense to radiation detection and neutron scatter simulation.

Edward was awarded SOME AWARDS.

Edward was also an active member of the Nuclear Science Design Team at Missouri University of Science and Technology. While on the team he solved radiation transport problems to facilitate the dosimetry of an inertial electrostatic confintement fusion device being constructed.
