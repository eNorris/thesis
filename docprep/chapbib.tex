This section is the literature review. I do these things.

\section{Introduction}
Many different things are required.

\section{CT Dose Estimation}
How is this done now?

\section{CT Phantom Generation}
The CT phantom is populated with CT numbers, also known as Hounsfield numbers. These values are related to the attenuation coefficient of the material represented by the voxel.

Many authors have provided correlations that map the CT number to both a material and a density.

First ones.

The new guy provides 19 materials. The density is measured.

Two phantom datasets are used in this work.

\section{Discrete Ordinates}
Discrete ordinates are old.

Dort and Tort.

Denovo.

\section{GPU Acceleration}
GPUs are cool.

CUDA is cool.


\section{Section with \texttt{natbib} Citations}

This had been discussed previously by \citep{bullwinkle.1990} and
\citet{bullwinkle.1991}. \lipsum[22-25]
